Legal Requirements for Accessing the ADRF
=========================================

You have been granted access to a computing environment with sensitive data. Thus it is important that you adhere to the terms of use you signed.

Disclosure of data should not happen at any time during your research project. Disclosure of data is every output you take out of the ADRF without going through the export process. This includes but is not limited to taking handwritten notes, taking screenshots or pictures, talking to somebody who is not on your project about specifics in the data, and working in a public space where external people might see your screen.

Anyone who knows or has reason to believe that another person has violated these processes should report the matter promptly to ADRF.

Consequences for unauthorized disclosure are disciplinary actions, up to and including termination of data access and any penalties outlined in the underlying data use agreement of the data being used.

Any attempt to retaliate against a person for reporting a failure to follow these processes may itself be considered a failure to follow these processes.
