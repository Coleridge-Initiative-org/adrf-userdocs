Accessing the ADRF
------------------
All users of the ADRF need to be uniquely identified and need to authenticate when accessing the Facility. Thus, access is implemented through a two factor authentication software. This means you login to your account with unique credentials and password, and a one time password obtained from a authentication app.

This includes a data explorer to find out what data is available in the ADRF and what other researchers using these data sources have published, an automated workflow to submit projects and manage data use agreements, and different software packages for data analysis.
