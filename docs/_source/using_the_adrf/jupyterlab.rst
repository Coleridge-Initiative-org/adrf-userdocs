JupyterLab
==========
JupyterLab is a web application that allows you to create and share documents
that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses
include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical
modeling, machine learning and much more.

To get started, double-click the Jupyter icon on the Desktop.

Directory Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Home Directory
""""""""""""""
By default, JupyterLab will open with your home folder as the default location
to save notebooks that you create. Any notebooks or files that you create in
this location will only be visible and accessible to you. Your screen should
look similar to the following.

*Note the house icon in the upper-left corner of the file navigator.*

Project Directory
"""""""""""""""""
Double-clicking the ``project`` folder will take you into the shared folder
of your team. Any notebooks or files saved here will be accessible to anyone on
your project.

Running a notebook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To start a new notebook, simply click one of the kernel options under
**Notebook** from the main Launcher panel (we recommend ADRF_Python3). You can
also use the file menu by selecting File > New > Notebook, then choosing which
kernel you'd like to use.

You can now write and run Python code. Try entering some code into the first
cell and running it using the Play button or **Shift + Return** on your keyboard.
