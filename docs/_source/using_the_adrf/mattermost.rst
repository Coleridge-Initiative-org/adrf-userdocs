==========
Mattermost is a flexible, open source messaging platform that enables secure
team collaboration, similar to Slack.

Initial Login
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you open Mattermost for the first time, you should see a message like the
one below.

In the ADRF, Mattermost will log you in automatically, but the first time requires
a synchronization process to run in order to add you to the appropriate teams.
Please allow up to 15 minutes for this to process, then check back later.
Afterwards you'll see a screen like below.
