Projects
=================
In order for members of a research group or team to effectively collaborate and share code, workspaces are created for each project. Specifically, this is a shared folder in the ADRF to which only the members of the research team have access.

Once in the ADRF, clicking on the `Files` icon on the left-hand side will open a file browser. From here, you will see a `Projects` folder which contains all project workspaces. Inside the `Projects` folder, you will have access to any project workspaces you are a member of.

While you are able to organize your project however you wish, there are 3 folders that are created by default to assist in project organization:

export: The export folder is used at the end of your project lifecycle for placing your research outputs into for export review.
shared: The shared folder is accessible to all members of your team and the recommended location for placing data and code that are to be used by the entire group.
user: Inside the user folder, each individual team member has a folder with which only they have access to
