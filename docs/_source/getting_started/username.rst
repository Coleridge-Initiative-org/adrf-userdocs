Claiming your username and password
===================================

The ADRF uses two-factor authentication for additional security. You'll need to install an one-time password (OTP) application to your mobile device such as DuoMobile.

Download DuoMobile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download DuoMobile to your phone or tablet.

Log in using credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to http://bit.ly/adrf-id and log in using the credentials you received via email. If you have not received credentials, please contact support at support@adrf.zendesk.com

Scan QR code
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scan the QR with the app. Enter the 6 digit code into the website and click Submit.

Note on OneTimePasswords: The important thing to know about these one-time codes is that any given 6 digit code only works for a 30 second window. Your app represent this validity window with a circle that starts out full, and disappears, as if a clock hand was erasing it. When the circle has disappeared, that 6 digit code is no longer valid.

If, when you first generate a code, the circle is just a small wedge, you might want to wait for that code to expire, and just use the next code so that you have a full 30 seconds to get it typed in.


Enter new password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enter a new password and click the Submit button.

Now that your username and password are configured, learn how to login to the ADRF in the Accessing the ADRF section. Please be aware that after the initial set up, it may take up to 2 minutes for your credentials to become active.
