Accessing the ADRF
==================
Once you have your account set up you can sign into the ADRF and access your workspace. There are two ways to access the ADRF. You can log into the web application, where you can access the data explorer, find information on your active projects, and a link to launch your workspace. But you can also access your workspace directly without going through the web application.


Sign in via the Web Application 
-------------------------------
Please go to https://ds.adrf.cloud/ which will bring you to the log in screen as pictured below.

After your first login, you can find the ADRF onboarding in the navigation bar. In the right-upper corner you can see you account name and clicking on it will lead you to your personal page where you can provide information about yourself. In the middle of the screen you will see two panels. You can submit new research projects in the first one. The second panel will bring you to your workspace in the ADRF.
