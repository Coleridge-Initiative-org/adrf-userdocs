Encryption and Decryption
=========================
Once data is encrypted, data transfer is handled either of two ways. One is through in person transfers and the other through SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). 

In person data transfer can be done by coordinating with NYU employees about the best way to commit the transfer. Once done, the data will be uploaded directly to the correct RSF destination on the ADRF.
 
In order to perform the SFTP transfer, an account on a remote server must be made for the data provider first. The data provider will receive an email asking them to update their password, as well as credentials to access the remote transfer server. Once done, the data provider should download WinSP or Cyberduck, software that allows for SFTP transfer through a GUI interface. The GUI will ask for the credentials that the data provder received by email. Once entered, the data provider may upload the encrypted and, if needed, hashed data to the remote server. The data provider will then alert NYU employee that the data has been uploaded. From there, the NYU employee will move the data to the correct RSF destination on the ADRF.
