Metadata
========
Before transfer, a metadata form, which can be downloaded here (will be hyperlinked to the metadata form) will be filled out by the data provider. On the worksheet titled dataset core description, please fill in all relevant, mandatory metadata fields in the column: Value. On the second worksheet titled data fields, describe the fields in your data. 

Other Metadata, documentation, and the completed metadata form will be loaded directly into the RSF project space within the RSF environment. Data curators will move documentation to “shared” directory within RSF project space.

Information from the metadata form will then be made available on the Data Stewardship Application.
