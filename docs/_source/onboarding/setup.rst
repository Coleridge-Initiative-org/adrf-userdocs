Account Registration
====================
The guide below will help you to set up your account and provide you with everything you need to know to successfully connect to your workspace in the ADRF.

Register for an Account
-----------------------
If you don't have an ADRF account yet, the first step to create an account is to register with us. Please go to https://ds.adrf.cloud/ and click the register button. After you click the register button you will be directed to the following screen.

Please fill out the form with your information and hit the sign up button when you're ready. This will notify us and initate a internal review if you are eligible for an account. Once your registration is approved our account will be created and you will receive an email with further instructions to fully set up the account.

Claiming your Username and Password
-----------------------------------

The ADRF uses two-factor authentication for additional security. You'll need to install an one-time password (OTP) application to your mobile device such as DuoMobile.

Download DuoMobile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Download DuoMobile to your phone or tablet. There is an app for iPhone and Android. You can find more information here: https://duo.com/product/trusted-users/two-factor-authentication/duo-mobile

Log in using credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Go to https://id.adrf.cloud/auth/realms/ADRF/account and this will take you to your ADRF account. You will see the following screen:

Please log in using the credentials you received via email. If you have not received credentials, please contact support at support@adrf.zendesk.com

Scan QR Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Scan the QR with the app. Enter the 6 digit code into the website and click Submit.

Note on OneTimePasswords: The important thing to know about these one-time codes is that any given 6 digit code only works for a 30 second window. Your app represent this validity window with a circle that starts out full, and disappears, as if a clock hand was erasing it. When the circle has disappeared, that 6 digit code is no longer valid.

If, when you first generate a code, the circle is just a small wedge, you might want to wait for that code to expire, and just use the next code so that you have a full 30 seconds to get it typed in.


Enter new password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Enter a new password and click the Submit button.

Any password you set must meet the following requirements, based on NIST password complexity guidance:

* 12 Characters
* 1 upper case letter
* 1 lower case letter
* 1 number
* 1 special character

Please be aware that after the initial set up, it may take up to 2 minutes for your credentials to become active. Accounts and credentials are provided to approved users only. Thus it is important that you do not share your credentials with other people. Always use your own credentials to login to ADRF. After three failed attempts the system will block you for 15 min before you can try again.

Please keep your password at a safe place, for example a key pass. Do not write it on a paper note. It is your responsibility to protect the credentials given to you and make sure your account is not being misused.
